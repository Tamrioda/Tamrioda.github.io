                <p>In English the name of our project was my defining moment. It was called this because we were talking about a moment of event in our life who made us who we are. "My defining moment" was to give people an insight on us a student. Let other get to know us and who we are and why we are who we are.

                <p>This is just a little piece from my narrative, “I was living with my grandmother since I was a child.My grandmother raised me after my father died and my mother was not able to. She was also here for me when I needed her and to think that I have to wake up everyday and not have her here will hurt. Without my grandmother I will feel incomplete (My grand is what we used to call my grandmother).”

                <h4></h4>
                <p>The purpose of my narriative it to let people know not to take the ones they have around them for granted”I just knew my grandmother would be ok, that she would come home in no time. I went over her house and just stared at the door because I was on her to come in the door but she never did. That moment I knew everything would change.” I lost my grandmother so quick i was so used to my grandmother going to the hospital and getting out but this time i didn’t go as planned.”

                <p>This project was a little difficult and emotional for me at times. When things got hard for me to handle i just tried to think of all the good fun times me and my grandmother had together. I thought about how proud she would be with me is she were here to see how i'm doing in school. Doing this project help me open up to other and show them why I am the way I am. </p>
