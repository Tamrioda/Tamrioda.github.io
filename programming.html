                <p>Programming is the action or process of writing computer programs. In my programming class we make web pages and apps that are very useful for us. They can also be used and played by other.Programming is a creative process done by programmers to instruct a computer on how to do a task. Hollywood has helped instill an image of programmers as uber techies who can sit down at a computer and break any password in seconds or make highly tuned warp engines improve performance by 500% with just one tweak. Sadly the reality is far less interesting!

                <p> The name of project is Celebrity Quiz! In Programming we were doing a project where you have to used what you learned and make something fun out of it. We were basically using our skills to show what we have learned over the last few weeks. Me and my partner decided to make what we learned fun for us and others at the same time.

                <p>For my project is started off as something simple to see if it would work. As we went more into the project we found more things we could use for our project. Our project was very simple at first. But we had to think, what do other games look like? What do they include? They show you your score.They include the instruction to the project. We went around to get a few opinions on our project to perfect it.</p>

                <p>This is what the project will look like when it is completed. The way you play our game is, when you first enter the game you will get instruction on how to play the game you will be told to press enter when you are ready to move on. Then you will be prompted with your first question. You will then put in the answer of the question you believe is right. If you get the question right it will tell you your score. Then it will give you a compliment if you answered correctly. If not this is will simply tell you to try again. At the end of the game you will get your score. A prompt will pop up thanking you for playing my game.
