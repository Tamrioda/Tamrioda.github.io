                <p>In Math we were workng on a project called failed products. With this project we were finding products that used to be on the market but no longer is. We had to find out when the product came out and when it was took of the market and why it was took of the market.</p>

          <CENTER>  <br>  <p>Multi Colored Ketchup which was originally known for Ez Squirt. It was a product made by Heinz. Multi Colored Ketchup came out in 2000. It came out in the colors Electric Blue and Funky Purple. After they sold so many of those they then came out with orange,purple,teal,blue, and pink. This product finally failed in 2006. Multi colored ketchup was claimed to have failed for many reasons. The made the product to attract children.In this artilce i read it stated “ But children aren't the ones buying the ketchup. Adults don't want to be putting different colored "goo" as many called it, on their food”.It was stated that children sometimes would mix the colors together and it made a nasty brown color that the parents didn’t like.They also didn’t like the product because ketchup was supposed to be red. Parents didn’t like the fact that they changed the genetic makeup of the original ketchup. While changing the color they changed the texture of the ketchup. Lastly we all know that children have a short attention span so, they lost interest very fast for the new colored ketchup. After they lost interest parents had no problem never buying the product ever again. So after this there was nothing the could have done to keep the product alive. In my opinion I would have liked it but I wouldn’t eat it i would play with it and mix the colors together like the other kids did. But if i had children then i wouldn’t buy it for my kids. This looks like a waste of money. It failed because kids lost interest. In a article it stated ”In 2012, Burger King teamed up with Heinz to resurrect the “green ketchup” concept, this time as part of a St. Patrick’s Day promotion in which free fries were given away with packets of the emerald sauce. As of this writing, neither company has announced plans to revive the gimmick in the foreseeable future”.</p> </br> </CENTER>
