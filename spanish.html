                <h3>Original Day Of The Dead Tradition</h3>
                <h4></h4>
                <p>Day of the Dead is an interesting holiday celebrated in central and southern Mexico during the chilly days of November 1 & 2. Even though this coincides with the Catholic holiday called All Soul's & All Saint’s Day, the indigenous people have combined this with their own ancient beliefs of honoring their deceased loved ones.

They believe that the gates of heaven are opened at midnight on October 31, and the spirits of all deceased children (angelitos) are allowed to reunite with their families for 24 hours. On November 2, the spirits of the adults come down to enjoy the festivities that are prepared for them.In most Indian villages, beautiful altars (ofrendas) are made in each home. They are decorated with candles, buckets of flowers (wild marigolds called cempasuchil & bright red cock's combs) mounds of fruit, peanuts, plates of turkey mole, stacks of tortillas and big Day-of-the-Dead breads called pan de muerto. The altar needs to have lots of food, bottles of soda, hot cocoa and water for the weary spirits. Toys and candies are left for the angelitos, and on Nov. 2, cigarettes and shots of mezcal are offered to the adult spirits. Little folk art skeletons and sugar skulls, purchased at open-air markets, provide the final touches.

Day of the Dead is a very expensive holiday for these self-sufficient, rural based, indigenous families. Many spend over two month's income to honor their dead relatives. They believe that happy spirits will provide protection, good luck and wisdom to their families. Ofrenda building keeps the family close.

On the afternoon of Nov. 2, the festivities are taken to the cemetery. People clean tombs, play cards, listen to the village band and reminisce about their loved ones. Tradition keeps the village close. Day of the Dead is becoming very popular in the U.S.~ perhaps because we don't have a way to celebrate and honor our dead, or maybe it's because of our fascination with it's mysticism.

                <p>For this project I choose to do someone who meant the most to me. Someone I lost a year ago. I choose my grandmother, her name was Alma Walker. She died on Feburary 19, 2015. She raised me most of my life. She was more like a mother than a grandmother. She died 2 weeks after her birthday. She was the only grandother that I knew. I didn't know my other grandmother. My grandmother took care of me as a child after my father passed away and my mother was not able to. I choose the picture I choose because I love that picture of my grandmother. In Day of The Dead you make a altar for the person with all the things that they are remembered for. I put green flowers and candles on my grandmothers altar. Green is her favorite color also.</p>

                <p>My grandmothers altar has a consist of all the following.</p>
               <ul>
                   <li> A picture of Church's chicken because that was her favorite chicken restaurant.Everytime we use to go to the doctor or we were waiting on the doctor we would go across the street to church's. Even when she used to go out shopping she always came back in the house with church's. </li>
                   <li> A picture of God because she loved and worshiped him. She went to church every Sunday and bible classes on Thursday's. She always made us go to. My grandmother was also a faith filled woman who had no problem showing it. She loved the lord and wanted everyone to know. </li>
                   <li> A picture of slot machines because she loved to go to the casino. If she wasn't at church and at work she was at the slot machines. On her spare time she played the machine. She loved to play bingo and other games also. If my grandmother couldn't make it to the slot machines then she would play a slot machine game on her computer at home.</li>
                   <li> A picture that states "If You Don't Have Something Nice To Say Don't Say Anything At All. Along with raising me my grandmother also raised my two brother and my four cousin. Me and my brother were the youngest. So usually in the house the little ones got picked on the most. My cousin use to make fun of us all the time. We could be sitting at the kitchen table eating and my grandmother would go get her belt because we would never stop talking about each other. The way me and my family played wasn't in a nice way. So she always told us " If You Can't Say Something Nice Don't Say Anything At All. Even though she always told me this i find it very hard to not say anything at all.</li>
